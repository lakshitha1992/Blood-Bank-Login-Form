# Heart Rate Monitor with Login Form

This project is a simple HTML-based simulation of a heart rate monitor, with a dynamic heartbeat animation and a login form. The heart rate dynamically adjusts as the user interacts with the form input fields.

## Features

- **Heartbeat Animation**: A smooth, animated heartbeat line representing a heart rate monitor, with a pulse glow effect.
- **Login Form**: A login form for the "Blood Bank System" with email and password input fields.
- **Dynamic Heart Rate**: As the user interacts with the login form, the heart rate percentage changes.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap 5.
- **Pulse Effect**: The heartbeat pulse line glows with a gradient effect to mimic real-time heart rate fluctuations.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
  - Custom CSS for heart rate monitor and animations
- **JavaScript**:
  - Dynamic heart rate update when typing in the form
  - Event listener to simulate keydown interactions with the heartbeat line

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lakshitha1992/heart-rate-monitor.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to see the live simulation.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your browser.
2. The login form is displayed in the center, with a simulated heart rate monitor on the background.
3. Type in the **email** and **password** fields to see the heart rate percentage increase in real-time.
4. The heartbeat animation will pause and reset with every key press.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the following:

- **Heart Rate Simulation**: Modify the `adjustHeartRate()` function to simulate a more complex heart rate pattern or fetch dynamic data.
- **CSS Styling**: Modify the background gradient, color scheme, and layout as per your requirements.
- **Animations**: Adjust the speed and style of the heartbeat animation by modifying the keyframes.
